    ===== General Framework Considerations =====    
    
    - The entire communication in an Application is managed by a Context object. The Context manages the low-level data transfer and Socket object creation.
    - The Context object uses a I/O thread in the background to get data from the network and then dispatch it the application. Local queues are used to exchange messages on the network and between applications which use the same Context.
        - if no communication over the network is required, you don't need an I/O thread.
    - Context object is used to create sockets which carry out the communication. Sockets could be of different types (REQ, REP, PUB, SUB, DEALER, etc.)
    - Context - container for all application's sockets and transport between inproc communication
        - create one per process - zmq.Context.instance() for global app context or Context() to create separate context
        - before terminating the process destroy it - context.destroy(linger=None). All active sockets should be closed before calling this.
          Clients should normally close the connections (otherwise the server will get a lot of sockets in TIME_WAIT state).
          There is a term() method but it doesn't close all sockets first. It actually waits for all sockets to be closed first before it returns.

    - ZMQ Sockets are not network sockets though they provide an API that is very similar to those of traditional sockets (close(), bind(), connect(), setsockopt(), etc.)
        - ZMQ Sockets are more like queues which distribute messages according to the type of the Socket.
            - the send() method is called the message is only queued internally. It doesn't mean that it was already sent.
        - ZMQ Sockets work with messages rather than byte streams
        - ZMQ Sockets can connect and bind to multiple endpoints at the same time (in contrast traditional sockets can be connected or bound to a single address)
        - ZMQ Sockets are not thread safe. Use one Socket should be used by a single thread.
        - ZMQ Sockets' queue are limited in size (HWM - High-Water Mark). You can set/get the option on a Socket instance with get/set_hvm. When the number of messages queued reaches the HWM Sockets go into "mute state". Depeding on the Socket type the messages are either discarded or the sender is blocked.
            - some sockets have only send or only receive buffers. Some both. Depends on the type.
                : PUB, PUSH - only send buffers (because they can't receive messages)
                : SUB, PULL, REQ, REP - only receive buffers (SUB, PULL can't send messages) and REQ/REP can only send one message at a time.
                : DEALER, ROUTER, PAIR - both types
            - hwm settings are not exact (e.g. if you set a limit for 1000 buffered messages it could be lower)
            - inproc hwm is the sum of hwm on both the receiver and sender sides
        - ZMQ Sockets can be of different types. Type specific (as well as general) options can be set by calling setsockopt()
        - ZMQ Sockets can be bound to many endpoints at once !
        - ZMQ Sockets must be closed in the thread that created them
    - To poll a set of ZMQ sockets at once use the Poller() object with its register/unregister/poll methods.
    
    ===== Socket Types in ZMQ =====
    - REQ - send and receives one message at a time. 
        - Attempting to send 2 times consecutively will cause an error. Only works when sending and receiving in lock-step. 
        - Can be connected to multiple address but will send one message to one address at a time. 
        - The ordering is round-robin.
        - Can send a message even if there are no servers listening. Once a Socket binds to the address and does a recv() the message from the client will be delivered.
            ::: setsockopt
    - REP - same as REQ except that it first receives and then sends. Also works in lock-step. 
        - Can receive from multiple clients but before receiving from the next client needs to reply to the client from which it received the current message.
        - The message which will be received first (if multiple are available) is the message that was sent first.
        - Sending a reply to a client which has closed the connection does not generate an error, i.e. is silently ignored.
            ::: setsockopt
    - DEALER - can send and receive in any order and as many times as it likes.
        - Can be connected to multiple addresses and send the messages in round-robin fashion.
        - Will queue the messages until there is a service to receive them. Will block if the HWM is reached when sending messages or then receiving if no sender is available
        - When connected to a REP service must send an empty message followed by one ore more actual body parts. Otherwise the REP discards the messages.
        - Dealers can have identities (dealer_socket.setsockopt(zmq.IDENTITY, "some-id")). Then a router sends message it could target a specific dealer by including the ID as first part of the multipart message.
            ::: setsockopt
    - ROUTER - can send and receive multiple messages in any order but sends only to specified peers (i.e. not round-robin)
        - Can be connected to multiple addresses.
        - The message that it sends should contain an identity part and payload part. Identity part is removed when actual send takes place but is used to identify the party that receives the message.
        - When the router receives the message it adds as first frame the id of the sender
        - When sending the message you must add manually the identity of the receiver as the message's first frame
        - If the message is send to a non-existent destination it will be discarded unless "mandatory" option is set
            ::: setsockopt
    - PUB - sends a message to a list of subscribers. Note that each message is sent to each subscriber (i.e. duplicated so the hwm for sending messages should be increased if more subscribers are added)
        - best way to send message is to create a multipart message with first part the topic name and second part the message contents.
        - also can add between the 2 parts the address of the publisher so that the subscriber can send smth. to the publisher via another socket (can't use PUB to receive message)
        - messages are discarded if the HWM is reached
            ::: setsockopt
    - SUB - receives message from a topic it is subscribed to. The topic name is taken by prefix matching against the message contents
            ::: setsockopt
                - setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, topic-name)
    - XPUB -
            ::: setsockopt
    - XSUB - 
            ::: setsockopt
    - PUSH -
            ::: setsockopt
    - PULL -
            ::: setsockopt
    - PAIR - can be used to connect one sender with exactly on receiver and vice-versa, i.e. only 2 sockets can talk.
        - is used mostly for synchronization between threads (synchronization is done via sending messages)
            ::: setsockopt
    - STREAM -
            ::: setsockopt

    ===== Messages in ZMQ =====   
    - Concepts
        - frame - a block of data preceeded by its length
    - General considerations
        - each single message (also multipart messages) must fit in memory
        - the delivery of messages is guaranteed to be atomic (even multipart). Either all or nothing is received/sent.
    - Simple
        - message consisting of one frame only
    - Multipart
        - message consisting of multiple frames. Each frame except the last one should be sent with zmq.SNDMORE flag.
          Receiving the message is done with a single call to recv_multipart().
    - Sending message:
        - in C there are send/recv and zmq_msg_send/zmq_msg_recv. In Python there is no such distinction.

    ===== Messaging patterns in ZMQ =====

    - GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
        - socket types shouldn't be combined arbitrarily. They come in pairs to implement a communication pattern between endpoints.
        - valid (direct) socket combinations. Either side can bind() or connect()
            PUB and SUB
            REQ and REP - implement lock-step request-reply communication between 2 endpoints
                - multiple REQ can send each their request independently but the REP server must receive and then reply
                  to each REQ before receiving the next request.
            REQ and ROUTER
            DEALER and REP
            DEALER and ROUTER - implement asynchronous request-reply communication between 2 endpoints
                - unlike REP/REQ you can receive as many message as you like and reply to them in any order
            DEALER and DEALER
            ROUTER and ROUTER
            PUSH and PULL
            PAIR and PAIR
    - Basic Patterns:
        - Request-Reply
        - Pub-Sub
        - Pipeline
        - Exclusive pair
